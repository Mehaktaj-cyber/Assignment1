        <b><u><h1>Lonely:-</h1></u></b>
        <h2>by Micheal Bartram</h2>

        I have no true friends, nobody to care.
        I’m not alone in this, it’s not very rare.
        Lots of lonely people feel the same.
        But should we feel a sense of shame?
        An admission of guilt, to some it seems.
        A life were friendship comes in dreams.
        Am I my worst enemy, yes probably so?
        I'm a very complex man to get to know.
        I am a fragile man, deep down inside.
        Emotions to display...but tears to hide.
        Relationships in my life, I've had a few.
        Even then, only loneliness I really knew.
        I love company, I'm not a loner in any way.
       Yet, I wake up alone to another lonely day.
